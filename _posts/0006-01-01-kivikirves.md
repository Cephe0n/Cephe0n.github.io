An Android game where you build six different kinds of stone axes using two minigames with three difficulty settings.
First hack off branches to make a handle, then sharpen a stone with a timing minigame.
Once your axe is complete, use a surface-tracking AR view to make your axe appear on your desk, floor etc. where you can rotate and move it freely, as well as take photos.
