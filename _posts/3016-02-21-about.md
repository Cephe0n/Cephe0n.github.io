<hr />

It was time to recreate my web site and I stumbled upon Jekyll.
Browsing the [Jekyll themes](http://jekyllthemes.org), I saw that some of the
ones I liked the most were created with the designs of [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net).
At the time, none of the Jekyll themes had the small static menu header that I was
looking for, so I browsed HTML5 UP directly and came across the Spectral theme.
I decided that it was perfect, and so began the Jekyll hack of Spectral to
create my site and this repo.

HTML5 UP's Spectral is primarily a landing page design with support for a few
pages linked off from the menu. When I posted the first
[_Jekyll theme_ for Spectral](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/spectral/),
I didn't really add much Jekyll coding to make it suitable for a
blog and portfolio. After forking my personal site from that original, I had intended
to merge some features back to the original, but it has expanded so much that
this will never happen. And also, there are many who do just want to use Spectral
as a landing page---change a few config variables and be on their way.
That original Spectral Jekyll theme is, however, in need of a little love,
so whether Spectral is host to a couple pages or many, it should someday at
least provide the first two features listed on the next page.
