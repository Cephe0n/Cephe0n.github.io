An ambitious project with a deadline of only 12 weeks. Mechalon VR is a VR-only mech combat game, where you fight 7 AI-controlled opponents in free-for-all matches
across three difficulties or "leagues", with an agile. jetpack-equipped mech of your own. You have access to four separate weapons, which are aimed using your 
head movement. In between matches, use the money you earn to upgrade your speed, armor and weapons in multiple ways.
