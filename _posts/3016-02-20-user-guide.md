<hr />

The [Github README](https://github.com/arkadianriver/arkadianriver.com)
has set up and usage info, whereas this guide is about authoring posts.

{% include post_note.html text="This user guide is provided in the _posts folder of the Github repo. Because the posts are dated in the future they are not part of a standard production build. However, if you intend to host your site on Github pages, keep in mind that they publish with future set to true. So, keep future set to false in your _config.yml file, move these 31st century pages to the _drafts folder, or delete these pages and just refer to the online guide linked-to from the Github README." %}
