#### About the project

Others in team: One 3D/2D artist, one 3D artist, one musician<br>
Platforms: All PC OpenVR-compatible headsets with motion-tracked controllers<br>



A game jam project with a 48-hour time limit. In keeping with the theme of the 2020 jam, "repair", in Craftwerk Corps you work at a zombie factory.
Zombie torsos get delivered to you on a belt, use teleportation movement and motion-tracked controllers to push buttons, grab zombie limbs and hammer them in place with your trusty mallet.
Try to get as many zombies built as you can before your shift ends, to raise you "employee rating".
