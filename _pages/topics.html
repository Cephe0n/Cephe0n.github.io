<h1 style="text-align:center">About me</h1>

<p id="centerText">Ever since I was old enough to reach the keyboard on my own, video games have been my passion. <br>
After spending a few of my adulthood years trying out different jobs, in 2017 I finally decided <br>
to follow my dreams and enrolled in JAMK University of Applied Sciences, with the goal of becoming a programmer. <br><br>
That same year I also purchased my first VR headset, the HTC Vive. After my first VR experience <br>
completely blew my mind, I realized the immense potential in this new technology and knew it was what I wanted to specialize in. <br><br>
Since then, I've tried to learn all I can about Unity, C# and XR technology in general. I've done <br>
projects, big and small, for both school groups as well as finnish companies. I'm currently working <br>
on finishing my last year of school and also adding Unreal Engine and C++ to my skillset. <br><br>
I'm currently looking for more work and would like nothing more than to help other people bring their <br>
dream projects to life, whether it's XR or not, PC or mobile, game, app or anything in between!
